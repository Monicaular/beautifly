### Agile Methodology

This project follows an Agile methodology to ensure flexibility, collaboration, and continuous delivery of features. Here's how the process is managed:
- **User story creation**: User stories are created to define the project goals and user requirements. Each story is a concise description of a feature from the user's perspective, helping to clarify what needs to be built and why.
- **Iterations**: The work is organized into iterations (sprints), with each iteration focusing on completing specific user stories. This approach helps to keep tasks organized and planned, ensuring that progress is made steadily.
- **Progress tracking**: Progress is tracked using GitHub project boards. User stories move from To Do to In Progress, and finally to Done when completed. This helps in keeping track of what's being worked on and what's already completed.
- **Priority labelling**:
    User stories are labeled to manage their priority effectively:
    - **Must Have**: Essential features that will be delivered.
    - **Should Have**: Important features that should be delivered but are not critical.
    - **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features that add value but are not essential.
    - **Won't Have**: Features that will not be included in this project cycle.

This approach helps to maintain focus on delivering the most important features while allowing flexibility for adjustments as the project progresses.
