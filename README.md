## Agile Methodology

This project follows an Agile methodology to ensure flexibility, collaboration, and continuous delivery of features. Here's how the process is managed:
- **User story creation**: User stories are created to define the project goals and user requirements. Each story is a concise description of a feature from the user's perspective, helping to clarify what needs to be built and why.
- **Iterations**: The work is organized into iterations (sprints), with each iteration focusing on completing specific user stories. This approach helps to keep tasks organized and planned, ensuring that progress is made steadily.
- **Progress tracking**: Progress is tracked using GitHub project boards. User stories move from To Do to In Progress, and finally to Done when completed. This helps in keeping track of what's being worked on and what's already completed.
- **Priority labelling**:
    User stories are labeled to manage their priority effectively:
    - **Must Have**: Essential features that will be delivered.
    - **Should Have**: Important features that should be delivered but are not critical.
    - **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features that add value but are not essential.
    - **Won't Have**: Features that will not be included in this project cycle.

This approach helps to maintain focus on delivering the most important features while allowing flexibility for adjustments as the project progresses.

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

I created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visually represent the database structure and relationships within the project. This ERD was carefully crafted to ensure efficient data management and clear associations between various entities, such as products, users, orders, and ratings. By mapping out the database design in advance, I was able to identify and implement the necessary tables and relationships, ensuring that the application's data flow is both logical and scalable.

![Database Schema](documentation/erd-wholesome-basket.png)

<br>

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

<br>

## Main Plan

- **Designing a visually appealing homepage** that highlights the website's focus on whole foods, making it clear to users what the site offers right from the start.
- **Implementing a product catalog** that allows users to browse, search, and filter products based on various criteria such as categories, price, and ratings.
- **Setting up secure user accounts** to enable features like adding items to wishlists, saving basket contents, and providing a personalized shopping experience with faster checkouts.
- **Developing a fully responsive website** that delivers a seamless user experience across all devices, with special attention to mobile-friendly navigation and optimized page load speeds.
- **Empowering superusers with the ability** to manage the product catalog, including adding, editing, and deleting products, as well as managing categories and user accounts directly from the admin panel.

## Fixed Bugs

Here are some of the bugs I encountered along with the solutions I implemented.

- After checkout, the user was receiving three email confirmations, with one of them not displaying the total costs. The first issue was in the webhook handler related to processing the payment intent. The payment was not succeeding because one of the order objects wasnâ€™t recognized during the initial payment intent. I identified the problematic object by process of elimination and removed it, as it wasnâ€™t necessary given that the Stripe payment ID (pid) is unique for each transaction. The second issue was on the Stripe account, where two webhooks were enabled, causing the confirmation to be sent twice. I resolved this by disabling one of the webhooks.

- Another frustrating bug was caused by an unclosed div tag that was obscuring my Django messages. After spending hours debugging without success, I reached out to tutor support, and they helped me identify the issue.

- When adding a new product on the product management page, the form wouldnâ€™t allow me to save more than one nutrition fact, related product, or fast fact. I resolved this issue by modifying the view.


- A particularly significant bug I encountered occurred when I forgot to add my `env` file to the `.gitignore` file, resulting in all my secret keys being exposed in the repository. With the assistance of the tutors, I was able to resolve this issue using a tool called `git filter-repo`, which successfully removed the sensitive data from my commit history.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

<br>

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This project utilizes [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) to store media and static files online, as Heroku does not persist this type of data.

To connect your project to AWS, follow these steps after creating and logging into your AWS account. Ensure youâ€™re on the **AWS Management Console** page.

#### S3 Bucket Setup

- Search for **S3** in the console.
- Create a new bucket, name it (preferably matching your Heroku app name), and choose the region closest to you.
- Uncheck **Block all public access** and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (necessary for it to function with Heroku).
- Under **Object Ownership**, ensure **ACLs enabled** and **Bucket owner preferred** are selected.
- In the **Properties** tab, enable static website hosting and enter `index.html` and `error.html` in their respective fields, then click **Save**.
- In the **Permissions** tab, enter the following CORS configuration:

	```shell
	[
		{
			"AllowedHeaders": [
				"Authorization"
			],
			"AllowedMethods": [
				"GET"
			],
			"AllowedOrigins": [
				"*"
			],
			"ExposeHeaders": []
		}
	]
	```

- Copy your **ARN** string.
- In the **Bucket Policy** tab, click on the **Policy Generator** link and follow these steps:
	- Policy Type: **S3 Bucket Policy**
	- Effect: **Allow**
	- Principal: `*`
	- Actions: **GetObject**
	- Amazon Resource Name (ARN): **paste-your-ARN-here**
	- Click **Add Statement**
	- Click **Generate Policy**
	- Copy the generated policy and paste it into the **Bucket Policy Editor**:

		```shell
		{
			"Id": "Policy1234567890",
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
					"Action": [
						"s3:GetObject"
					],
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
					"Principal": "*"
				}
			]
		}
		```

	- Before saving, add `/*` to the end of the Resource key in the Bucket Policy Editor (as shown above).
	- Click **Save**.
- In the **Access Control List (ACL)** section, click "Edit" and enable **List** for **Everyone (public access)**, and accept the warning box.
	- If the edit button is disabled, ensure the **Object Ownership** section above is set to **ACLs enabled**.

#### IAM Setup

In the AWS Services Menu, search for and open **IAM** (Identity and Access Management). Follow these steps:

- Go to **User Groups** and click **Create New Group**.
	- Suggested Name: `group-retro-reboot` (group + project name)
- Tags are optional, but required to proceed to the **review policy** page.
- In **User Groups**, select your newly created group and go to the **Permissions** tab.
- Open the **Add Permissions** dropdown and click **Attach Policies**.
- Select the appropriate policy, then click **Add Permissions**.
- In the **JSON** tab, click on **Import Managed Policy**.
	- Search for **S3**, select the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy, and then **Import**.
	- Paste your ARN from the S3 Bucket into the "Resources" key on the Policy:

		```shell
		{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": "s3:*",
					"Resource": [
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
						"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
					]
				}
			]
		}
		```
	
	- Click **Review Policy**.
	- Suggested Name: `policy-retro-reboot` (policy + project name)
	- Provide a description:
		- "Access to S3 Bucket for retro-reboot static files."
	- Click **Create Policy**.
- In **User Groups**, click your `group-retro-reboot`.
- Click **Attach Policy**.
- Search for the policy you just created (`policy-retro-reboot`), select it, then click **Attach Policy**.
- In **User Groups**, click **Add User**.
	- Suggested Name: `user-retro-reboot` (user + project name)
- For "Select AWS Access Type," choose **Programmatic Access**.
- Select the group to add your new user to: `group-retro-reboot`
- Tags are optional, but required to proceed to the **review user** page.
- Click **Create User**.
- Download the `.csv` file containing your **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** immediately.
	- **IMPORTANT**: You cannot download it again later.
	- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = **Access key ID**
	- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` = **Secret access key**

#### Final AWS Setup

- If `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` is still present in Heroku Config Vars, you can now remove it so AWS handles the static files.
- Within **S3**, create a new folder named `media`.
- Prepare and upload any existing media images to this new folder.
- Under **Manage Public Permissions**, select **Grant public read access to this object(s)**.
- Click **Upload**â€”no further settings are required.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to manage e-commerce payments.

After creating and logging into your Stripe account, follow these steps to connect your project:

- In your Stripe dashboard, expand the "Get your test API keys" section.
- You will see two keys:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (begins with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (begins with **sk**)

To handle cases where users might close the purchase-order page prematurely during payment, you can set up Stripe Webhooks:

- In your Stripe dashboard, go to **Developers** and select **Webhooks**.
- Click **Add Endpoint**.
	- Enter the URL: `https://wholesome-basket-e-commerce-72c9883373ee.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Choose **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to finalize the setup.
- You will get a new key:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Webhook) Key (begins with **wh**)

If you are using Gitpod, you can save these keys so that they don't need to be added each time you open the workspace.

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to manage sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

After creating and logging into your Gmail (Google) account, follow these steps to connect your project:

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Go to the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- In the "Change account settings" section, click on **Other Google Account settings**.
- On the new page, select **Security** from the left-hand menu.
- Enable **2-Step Verification** (you'll need to verify your password and account).
- Once verified, turn on **2FA**.
- Return to the **Security** page, where youâ€™ll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- You may be prompted again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** as the app type.
- Choose **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Enter any custom name, such as "Django".
- Youâ€™ll receive a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this key locally, as you wonâ€™t be able to access it later.
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = Your 16-character API key.
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = Your personal Gmail email address.

### Heroku Deployment

This project is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to build, run, and manage applications entirely in the cloud.

To deploy your project, follow these steps after setting up your Heroku account:

- In your Heroku Dashboard, click **New** in the top-right corner and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Choose a unique app name, select the region closest to you (EU or USA), and then click **Create App**.
- In the new appâ€™s **Settings** tab, click **Reveal Config Vars** and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | your value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | your value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | your value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*temporary, can be removed for final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | your value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | your value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | your value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | your value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | your value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | your value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku requires two additional files for proper deployment:
- `requirements.txt`
- `Procfile`

To install the projectâ€™s dependencies, run:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If youâ€™ve installed your own packages, update the `requirements.txt` file by running:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

Create the **Procfile** with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- Replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app (the folder containing `settings.py`).

To deploy your project to Heroku and connect your GitHub repository, you can:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app settings.

Or:

- Use the Terminal/CLI to connect to Heroku with: `heroku login -i`
- Set the Heroku remote: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your Heroku app name).
- After performing the usual Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, deploy to Heroku with:
	- `git push heroku main`

Your project should now be successfully connected and deployed on Heroku!

### Local Deployment

To create a local copy of this project on your system, you can either clone or fork the repository.

After obtaining the project files, youâ€™ll need to install the necessary packages listed in the *requirements.txt* file:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Next, create a new file called `env.py` at the root level of the project, and include the environment variables mentioned in the Heroku deployment steps.

Hereâ€™s a sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "your_value_here")

# For local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is set up locally, follow these steps to run it:

1. Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
2. Stop the app once it's loaded by pressing `CTRL+C` (or `âŒ˜+C` on Mac).
3. Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
4. Apply the migrations to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
5. Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
6. Load any fixtures, if applicable: `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)

Once everything is set up, run the Django app again using:
- `python3 manage.py runserver`
